/**Still brainstorming ------------ UNDER CONSTRUCTION
This is here just to show that I actually *am* working on it :P
Completely aware that it needs to be fixed up...
I will continue working on it monday morning and then see what other
contribution I can make...
If you want to change something I won't mind.
Keep calm and join the dark side...
Hail Sithis!
These unnecessary comments will be deleted when this part is finsihed **/
